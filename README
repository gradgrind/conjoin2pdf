This script uses LibreOffice to convert individual files to pdf in a temporary folder.
These files are then concatenated using the pdfrw module.
It is possible to specify that the number of pages from each document should be even,
so that double-sided printing works properly.

For (fairly) comfortable user interaction, there is a simple gui using tkinter.

LibreOffice must be installed in its standard location on Windows, otherwise (Linux)
accessible via the "libreoffice" command.
